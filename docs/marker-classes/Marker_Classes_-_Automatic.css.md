# Marker Classes - Automatic.css

Marker classes allow you to quickly control the styling of list markers (the “bullet” in a list is referred to as a “marker” in CSS).

Here’s a normal list:

*   List item 1
*   List item 2
*   Listen item 3

Here’s a list with `.marker--action` applied, which changes the bullets to the website’s action color (note that action color is now deprecated).

*   List item 1
*   List item 2
*   List item 3

Marker classes are available for every active color and shade using the syntax `.marker--[color]-[shade]`.
