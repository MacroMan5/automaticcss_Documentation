# ACSS & Oxygen Builder Setup

**Warning:** Soflyy has publicly referred to Oxygen as a legacy product and has clearly ended its commitment to innovation and meaningful progress. We highly recommend you switch to a modern, forward-thinking, and forward-moving product like [Etch](https://etchwp.com/) or [Bricks](https://bricksbuilder.io/).

## Our Official Position on Oxygen Compatibility

The Automatic.css framework, including many of its newest features, still work just fine in Oxygen. The new 3.0 dashboard loads in Oxygen and supports live preview. Some builder enhancements like Auto-BEM are available in Oxygen as well.

With that said, we have officially ended our commitment to ensuring that new features are fully compatible with Oxygen and are not prioritizing testing or bug fixing in Oxygen. Any potential issues related to security will still be addressed.

When Oxygen was first announced as legacy in June of 2022, we advised all customers to begin the process of switching to a new builder. It has now been more than two years since that advisory notice (which we repeated dozens of times over this two year period), which is plenty of time for users to take the necessary and appropriate action.

While most third party developers immediately abandoned Oxygen, we maintained compatibility for a full two years. However, maintaining this compatibility with the required testing, bug fixes, and time required to ensure all the new features work going forward is not economically feasible.
