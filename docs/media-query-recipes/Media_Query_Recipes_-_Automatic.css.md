# Media Query Recipes - Automatic.css

Media query recipes will expand a media query for any custom code that you’d like. The best part is that you don’t have to know the value of the breakpoint – the recipe does all the work.

## Max-Width Media Queries

*   `@breakpoint-xs`
*   `@breakpoint-s`
*   `@breakpoint-m`
*   `@breakpoint-l`
*   `@breakpoint-xl`
*   `@breakpoint-xxl`

## Min-Width Media Queries

*   `@breakpoint-up-xs`
*   `@breakpoint-up-s`
*   `@breakpoint-up-m`
*   `@breakpoint-up-l`
*   `@breakpoint-up-xl`
*   `@breakpoint-up-xxl`
