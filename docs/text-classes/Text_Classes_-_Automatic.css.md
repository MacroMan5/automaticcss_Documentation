# Text Classes - Automatic.css

Automatic.css has a full suite of classes for quickly styling text. All text styling classes start with **.text–** and use contextually accurate names to make them easy to remember. 

## Text Size

`.text--{size}`

Text size classes allow you to change text size anywhere on your site. They work when directly applied to elements, and they also work when applied to containers that house multiple text elements.

Text classes follow the Automatic typography system to be automatically responsive, follow a perfect mathematical scale, and have dual-layer fallback support.
