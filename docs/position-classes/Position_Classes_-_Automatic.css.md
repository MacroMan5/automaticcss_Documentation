# Position Classes - Automatic.css

These classes set the position of an element, with the two options being:

*   `.relative`
*   [`.sticky`](https://automaticcss.com/docs/sticky-classes/)

**Note:** Turning off position classes will not turn off sticky classes as sticky classes have a separate options toggle.
