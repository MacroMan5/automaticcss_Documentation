# Height Classes - Automatic.css

Height classes in Automatic.css set a minimum height on any element theyâ€™re applied to. We use a minimum height instead of a fixed height as best practice to prevent overflow issues.

Heights are available from 20 to 100 and are represented in vh units (e.g. `.height--50` applies a minimum height of 50vh).

*   `.height--20`
*   `.height--30`
*   `.height--40`
*   `.height--50`
*   `.height--60`
*   `.height--70`
*   `.height--80`
*   `.height--90`
*   `.height--100`

## Changing height at breakpoints

You can adjust the min-height at each breakpoint using our [breakpoint](https://automaticcss.com/docs/website-width-breakpoints/) height utilities. The convention is: `.height--[breakpoint]-[value]`.
